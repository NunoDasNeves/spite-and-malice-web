# TODO

## recent

- [x] reset button for fixing broken scene
- [x] glow all playable cards when its my turn
- [x] kick player button
- [x] remove lighting - it doesn't serve much purpose
- [x] fix play piles centering
- [x] whose turn indicator
- [x] reverse turn direction
- [x] move held card close to pile to indicate where it will play (discard or play pile)
- [x] glow for end turn button
- [x] redo animation system and existing animations to be more flexible
- [x] animate card putting
- [x] draw cards (fill hand) animation
- [x] stack card flip over animation

- [x] drop card and return it to where it was animation
- [x] shift cards in hand to restore spacing animation
- [x] move discard pile cards to only show a few at a time animation
- [x] handle undo of full play pile - need to implement undo differently I suppose - restore entire gameView
- [x] animate card dragging, smoothly
- [x] don't pause hovering/etc while animating/updating
- [x] randomize starting player
- [x] allow local moves regardless of latency
- [x] show colors in lobby
- [x] lobby link instead of code
- [x] undo button - undo any moves that don't reveal stack or draw pile cards
- [x] End turn button (in case you want to undo discard)
- [x] fix local testing with 5-6 players - infinite loop or recursion happening
- [x] Add font for cards to maintain consistency (not final font)
- [x] better (but still not final) joker card - hat on top where text is for other cards
- [x] disable zoom on stack - not needed now, due to big cards
    - this also fixes the issue where you touch to see stack size, but it zooms instead
- [x] discard only show top 3 (because cards are way bigger)

- [x] bigger card numbers/suites
- [x] other player's moves animation
- [x] switch to overhead cam (for now)
- [x] lobby highlight your player

- [x] card stacks - draw pile and player stacks
- [x] better player view positioning and camera
- [x] glow valid moves orange/gold
- [x] no glow/drag if not your turn
- [x] glow held card cyan
- [x] host on github

## next up
- [] fix possible out of order move packets (this shouldn't happen...but does sometimes, apparently)
- [] play a sound when it's your turn ('ding')
- [] card places should be outlines, maybe?
- [] move whose turn indicator or change it or something
- [] fix close browser doesn't disconnect me from the game?
- [] allow switching to lobby in game
- [] allow restarting game without creating new room
- [] skip buffered animations
- [] deal start of game animation
- [] border or glow around base of stack
- [] handle a tied game - no cards left in draw pile, can't discard
    - game logic may break (fix this first...)
    - animations will break e.g. animHandFill() will break
- [] allow host to customize game (num decks, stack size) from lobby
- [] undo animation?
- [] save logs to text file
- [] prevent swipe to refresh/zoom - use some css stuff
- [] better pile shuffle animation - doesn't look good with short draw pile
- [] Try to automatically re-create Host peer on disconnect (e.g. on iOS when in another app for too long)
    - If we can't get the same ID, recreate peer with new ID
        - Host needs to be able to share a new link to continue the same game
        - Maybe host goes back to lobby screen...? But then more lobby screen work is required
            - Maybe first rework the lobby so it can be viewed at any time during an ongoing game
- [] cycle through colors in lobby on click
- [] performance - stop using tonnes of CPU while idle
- [] move UI stuff away from iOS exit fullscreen button
- [] Try to automatically re-create remote peer & reconnect to Host on disconnect
    - Try periodically for some time (30 seconds?) then give up
- [] support back button? - or disable it
- [] native device sharing for link - navigator.share()
- [] undo last move (with click/drag) ?
- [] play card while shuffling froze the game - not sure why... fixCards fixed it
    - can't repro

## browser compatibility
- I mainly care about it working on mainstream modern up-to-date browsers
    - it needs to work well in ios/android...this is difficult
    - firefox, chrome, safari, (edge maybe)
    - windows, mac, linux, ios, android versions of these
- [] check what ES6 features I may be using that aren't compatible
    - []
- [] check what DOM APIs etc I need to support in multiple browsers and write code to support em
    - [] fullscreen api
    - []  
- may be easier to:
- [] npm-ify the project if needed
- [] module-ify the project if needed
- [] webpack or something if needed
- [] babel it - this doesn't fix DOM api stuff afaik, just polyfills ES6 stuff



## future
- [] emotes
- [] automated tests using local players/test game function
